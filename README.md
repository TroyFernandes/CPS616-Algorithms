### [Lab 1 - Sorting and Problem Size](https://github.com/TroyFernandes/CPS616-Algorithms/tree/master/Lab%201%20-%20Sorting%20and%20Problem%20Size/Lab%201)
Comparison of O(n<sup>2</sup>) algorithms (Selection Sort + Merge Sort). Three cases are tested:

1) Standard Selection Sort
2) Standard Merge Sort
3) Merge Sort with Selection Sort when the subarrays are small enough

### [Lab 2 - Divide and Conquer](https://github.com/TroyFernandes/CPS616-Algorithms/tree/master/Lab%202%20-%20Divide%20and%20Conquer/Lab%202%20-%20Divide%20and%20Conquer)

Large integer multiplication, where the result is too large to be stored in regular integer data types. Strings + Vectors are used to represent these large numbers
